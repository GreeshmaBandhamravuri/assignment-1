               <p>Naruto[a] is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, 
            a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village.
             The story is told in two parts: the first is set in Naruto's pre-teen years (volumes 1–27),
             
            and the second in his teens (volumes 28–72). The series is based on two one-shot manga by Kishimoto:
             Karakuri (1995), which earned Kishimoto an honorable mention in Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award the following year, 
             and Naruto (1997).

            Naruto was serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly
             Shōnen Jump from September 1999 to November 2014, with its chapters collected in 72 tankōbon volumes.
              Part I of the manga was adapted into an anime television series by Pierrot and Aniplex, which ran for 220 episodes
               from October 2002 to February 2007 on TV Tokyo; the English dub of the series aired on Cartoon Network and YTV from 
               September 2005 to December 2009. A second series, which adapts material from Part II of the manga, is titled Naruto: 
               Shippuden and ran on TV Tokyo for 500 episodes from February 2007 to March 2017. The English dub of Shippuden was broadcast
                on Disney XD in the United States from October 2009 to November 2011, airing the first 98 episodes before eventually 
                switching over to Adult Swim's Toonami programming block in January 2014, starting over from the first episode.
                 After Disney XD removed the series from broadcast, Viz Media began streaming new English dubbed episodes on their
                  streaming service Neon Alley in from December 2012 to March 2016, starting at episode 99 and ending at episode 338 due 
                  to the service's shutdown. Besides the anime television series, Pierrot also developed 11 animated films and 12 original 
                  
                  video animations (OVAs). Other Naruto-related merchandise includes light novels, video games, and trading cards developed
                   by several companies.A powerful fox known as the Nine-Tails attacks Konoha, the hidden leaf village in the Land of Fire,
                    one of the Five Great Shinobi Countries in the Ninja World. In response, the leader of Konoha and the Fourth Hokage, 
                    Minato Namikaze, at the cost of his life, seals the fox inside the body of his newborn son, Naruto Uzumaki, making
                     him a host of the beast.[i] The Third Hokage returns from retirement to become the leader of Konoha again. 
                     Naruto is often scorned by Konoha's villagers for being the host of the Nine-Tails. Due to a decree by the
                      Third Hokage forbidding any mention of these events, Naruto learns nothing about the Nine-Tails until 12 years
                       later, when Mizuki, a renegade ninja, reveals the truth to him. Naruto defeats Mizuki in combat, earning the respect
                        of his teacher, Iruka Umino.[ii]

                   Shortly afterward, Naruto becomes a ninja and joins with Sasuke Uchiha, against whom he often competes, 
                   and Sakura Haruno, on whom he has a crush, to form Team 7, under an experienced sensei, the elite ninja 
                   Kakashi Hatake. Like all the ninja teams from every village, Team 7 completes missions requested by the villagers,
                    ranging from doing chores and being bodyguards to performing assassinations.
                   
                   After several missions, including a major one in the Land of Waves, 
                   Kakashi allows Team 7 to take a ninja exam, enabling them to advance to a
                    higher rank and take on more difficult missions, known as Chunin Exams.
                     During the exams, Orochimaru, a wanted criminal, invades Konoha and kills the Third Hokage for revenge.
                      Jiraiya, one of the three legendary ninjas, declines the title of Fifth Hokage and searches with Naruto for Tsunade
                       whom he chooses to become Fifth Hokage instead.
                   
                   During the search, it is revealed that Orochimaru wishes
                    to train Sasuke because of his powerful genetic heritage, the Sharingan.[iii] After
                     Sasuke attempts and fails to kill his older brother Itachi,[iv] who had showed up in Konoha to kidnap Naruto,
                      he joins Orochimaru, hoping to gain from him the strength needed to kill Itachi.
                       The story takes a turn when Sasuke leaves the village: Tsunade sends a group of ninja, 
                       including Naruto, to retrieve Sasuke, but Naruto is unable to persuade or force him to come back.
                        Naruto and Sakura do not give up on Sasuke; Naruto leaves Konoha to receive training from Jiraiya to prepare
                         himself for the next time he encounters Sasuke, while Sakura becomes Tsunade's apprentice.</p>

                                    <p>Konohagakure was founded by friendly rivals Madara Uchiha and Hashirama Senju, with the latter
                                         becoming the first Hokage. Hashirama's dream of world peace was a guiding principle throughout Konoha's history,
                                          and his position of power comes from his renown as the "God of Shinobi," one of the strongest ninjas in the franchise.

                                        Notably, Hashirama wanted Madara to be the first Hokage, but his brother Tobirama Senju insisted upon a democratic election 
                                        that led to Hashirama's selection. Although he had many abilities at his disposal, Hashirama was most known for his Wood Release 
                                        technique that allowed him to manipulate wood and plants. Hashirama would go on to name Tobirama as his successor 
                                        before his death and later would be temporarily resurrected by Sasuke Uchiha and Orochimaru.</p>

Tobirama's time as Hokage was transformative, creating many institutions in the village like the Academy and the Anbu special forces squad, while also placing emphasis on village loyalty over clan loyalty.

                                    The Uchiha clan resisted this shift in ideology, beginning the fateful divide between their clan and Konoha leadership.
                                     Almost as powerful as his brother, Tobirama was capable of using many ninja techniques, although he was most known for his 
                                     Water Release mastery, as well as his invention of the Flying Thunder God Technique.
                                     He was resurrected temporarily alongside the other deceased Hokage during the Fourth Shinobi World War.

                                     which he attempted to balance by allowing Danzō Shimura to lead the ruthless Root organization.</p>

                                     teacher of Kakashi Hatake, Obito Uchiha, and Rin Nohara, as his successor. Notably, during his time as Hokage, Minato and Kushina
                                      Uzumaki had a child, Naruto Uzumaki, on the same night that the Nine-Tailed Fox attacked Konoha.

                                     his mastery over the Flying Thunder God Technique and the creation of his signature Rasengan, which his son would go on to master.

She is the granddaughter of the first Hokage, Hashirama Senju and his wife Mito Uzumaki, as well. Notably, her brother Nawaka and
